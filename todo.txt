To Do:

 - "init/bootstrap playbook" for the Rhaspberry:
   - removes "pi" account
 - add reboot + wait after package changes
 - Readme: configure Raspi to final IP before running init_rubix.yml
 - limit password logins to the console
 - configure repos for nodes to use rubix as a repo source
   - avoid installing internet surprise updates
   - don't forget to adjust kickstart file
 - the CentOS release version is still hard-coded. (7.4.1708)
 - re-mount ISO handler if download received a new file
 - preserve ssh hostkeys for nodes and rubix


 - rubix doesn't know its own hostname is rubix
 - rubix won't resolve the nodes on the 200 network
