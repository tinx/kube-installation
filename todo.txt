To Do:

 - "init/bootstrap playbook" for the Rhaspberry:
   - creates ansible account, with keys
   - removes "pi" account
 - add reboot + wait after package changes
 - all other playbooks assume presence of ansible user incl..keys
 - turn "static network config files" into templates (rubix-eth0 etc.)
 - also: rubix-dnsmasq-hosts.j2
